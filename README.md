Problem Statement:

Code deployment to higher environments often involves multiple manual steps, coordination among teams, and strict adherence to timelines. This process can be prone to delays, errors, and miscommunication, especially when creating and assigning tasks to teams like the Enterprise Deployment Services (EDS) team.

To address these challenges, a conversational chatbot can be introduced to streamline and automate the deployment process. The chatbot will assist in initiating deployments, tracking progress, and creating sub-tasks for the EDS team automatically. By providing real-time updates and facilitating seamless communication, the chatbot will enhance efficiency, reduce human errors, and improve collaboration across teams during code deployments to higher environments.
